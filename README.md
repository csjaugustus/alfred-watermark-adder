# Alfred Watermark Adder
Easily add custom watermarks to your image(s) via File Action.

## Installation
1. You need to have Python installed.
2. You need to have Pillow installed via `pip3 install Pillow`.

## Configuration
There are a couple of configurable variables to adjust font, font size, spacings, paddings, etc. Default values have been provided, so just adjust when required.

Most of the variables are self-explanatory. Most of them are percentage values, so that they scale in proportion to the watermark text dimensions.

## Visualization
Here's a visualization of the few more confusing variables:
